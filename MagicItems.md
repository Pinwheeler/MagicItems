The Cart Before the Horse  | Artifact - Carriage | This cart is a stagecoach that is an ominous black color. It is nondescript and plushly lined with plenty of room to carry as many passengers as you might want and all of their luggage so long as every passenger is going to the same place. Horses fear the cart and will shy away from it, but if put into its harness they will calm down. As soon as the last passenger of the party is fully loaded onto the carriage, it will teleport to the destination, but the horse will disappear...
